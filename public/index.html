    <h3>Let's Mosey!</h3>

    <p>Sure, I'll explain how Materia works. First, access the menu. You know the basic functions. The triangle button
      brings up the menu. Directional buttons move the cursor, like this. Select each menu by using the OK button. If
      you want to leave the menu, just push the CANCEL button. See? Let's go ahead. Now you're in this menu. Select
      [Materia] sub menu.
      Select who you want to use it. Now look at my weapon here. Each weapon and armor has slots in it. Choose which
      slot you want to put Materia in. Now select the Materia you want to use. This is curative Materia. If you want to
      know what its effect is, line the cursor up with [Check], and push the OK button. It's just like selecting battle
      commands. Just line the cursor up to [Magic], you can see that the available magic has increased. Now you can use
      new magic [Cure]. And that's all there is to equipping Materia. See? It wasn't that tough! When you want to remove
      any Materia, it's as easy as pointing to the materia slot, and pushing the triangle button. There's just one thing
      you have to be careful of.
      Whenever you equip Materia, your situation changes. Parts of you may become stronger... while others get weaker.
      Normally, when you equip [Magic] Materia, your magic power will get stronger. But your physical strength weakens.
      So,
      Materia's kind of a double-edged sword. On the left side of the screen, you can see the Materia's effect on you.
      It's wise not to overuse Magic Materia. But try out various things. Push the CANCEL button to exit the sub menu.
      Ok, that's about it. I'll give you some advanced tips later.</p>
