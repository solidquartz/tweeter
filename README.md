# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. It is my second project at Lighthouse Labs, and my first frontend-focused project.

Tweeter is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node, and Express, and uses Ajax and Flexbox. The database code (in /server) was pre-written by an instructor.

Feature highlights include a character counter, a fluid layout, dynamic error messages, and cute bouncing animations!

## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>. This command will enable nodemon.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.
5. The server can also be started using `npm start`.

## Dependencies
